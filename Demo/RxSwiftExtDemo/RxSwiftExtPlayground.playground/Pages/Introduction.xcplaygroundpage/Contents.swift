 # Introduction
 
 ## Additional operators for RxSwift
 
 The core RxSwift distribution provides an extensive set of operators to transform observables. RxSwift+Ext aims at providing those less needed or convenience operators that do not necessarily fit in the core distribution, while being useful to many.
 We think that these additional operators will help beginners and intermediate Rx users alike by offering straightforward solutions to some of the common problems Rx users need to solve.
 
 ## About this playground
 
 Each page in the playground provides examples of use for each operator RxSwift+Ext provides.
